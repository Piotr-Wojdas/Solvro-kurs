1. Naming the python file in a way that would indicate it's contents would be helpful for initial orientation in your repo

2. I've noticed the instructions present in both of your files, maybe extracting them to a separate file would be a good idea

3. It's great that you describe exactly what you're going to do before you code

4. Maybe indicating particular steps with python comments would be worthwhile for orientation between descriptions and code.

5. You mostly explain what can be deduced and how, which is also great

6. I like the emoji at the end `:)`
